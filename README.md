# Data Science and Statistical Analysis Projects

This is a sample of data science projects that have been conducted in various languages, including R, Python, and SPSS.  It is meant to provide a brief illustration of several concepts in applied statistical analysis and machine learning.  Where necessary, propriety data has been withheld or obscured.

# R
A collection of data science projects using R

## Shiny R Dashboard 
Created a Shiny (R) dashboard that intakes a raw .csv file and allows the user to select variables to perform multivariate forecasting using both ARIMA and Bayesian algorithms.

## Generalized Low Rank Model for Mixed Data Clustering
This is an example of R Code which applies numerous statistical functions to prepare mixed Survey data for clustering
[GLRM](GLRM/GLRM_R_Segmentation.ipynb)


# Forecasting and Time Series 

## SARIMAX Python Time Series Forecasting
This is an example of using Seasonal ARIMAX (without exogenous predictors).

## ARIMAX R
In this is similar to the previous analysis, however it was developed in R and is not a "seasonal" model.
