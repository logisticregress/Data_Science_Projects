## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(forecast)
jd = read.csv('jcdata.csv', head = T)   #load the dataset
jd1 = read.csv('jcdata_new.csv', head=T)  #load the out-of-sample data (for prediction period)

jd_ts = ts(jd, frequency = 12)  #convert dataset to time series
autoplot(jd_ts[,3])

```

```{r}
#Seasonal decomposition
sfit = stl(jd_ts[,3], s.window="period")
plot(sfit)
```

```{r}
#univariate time series
fit = auto.arima(jd$Sales)
jd_pred = forecast(fit, n = 12)
plot(jd_pred)
```
```{r}
#multivariate time series 
exo = cbind(jd$Intent, jd$Spend)   # create the data matrix for predictors 
fitx = auto.arima(jd$Sales, xreg = exo)

#Summary Table
summary(fitx)


```


```{r}
#Check Residuals 
checkresiduals(fitx)
```



```{r}
#Forecast (12 months ahead)
fcast = forecast(fitx, xreg=jd1)
